Mouse Speller
====

This project aims to show in a full-screen mode a matrix of letters included in colored rectangles.
Once the cursor of the mouse is hovering each rectangle the speller will pronounce the letter contained in that rectangle.
It can be used in combination with an eye-tracker, using this latter to control the cursor of the mouse.
